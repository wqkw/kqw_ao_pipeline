# NARRATIVE GENERATION GUIDE (Step 3 — after logline & lore are locked)

**Purpose**  
Transform the premise and world bible into a causal spine and sequence plan that can be executed. Focus on *decision pressure*: each beat forces a choice that raises cost or narrows options, cashing the promise of the premise. Leave shot design, lighting, and prop choreography to specialized agents; only specify thematically essential motifs when they are inseparable from the story’s argument.

---

## Choose a story spine & emotional shape (declare the tools)
Select a beat engine (e.g., Story Circle 8; 15-beat commercial scaffold; investigation lattice) that best expresses the logline’s conflict. Pair it with an **emotional trajectory** (rise, fall, fall-rise, zigzag). State why this pairing fits *this* premise and *these* pillars; the midpoint should pivot the emotional vector, not merely deliver information.

---

## Build a causal beat grid
- **Therefore/But logic:** every unit moves because the last one forced it.  
- **Act I:** establish ordinary operation under the world’s rules, lock the public goal, cross a no-return.  
- **Act II:** escalate through reversals and pinch points that explicitly exploit **Cost/Limit/Counter** from the lore’s systems; midpoint redefines the meaning of victory or exposes a hidden cost.  
- **Act III:** stage the decisive value choice implied by the logline’s irony; pay setups; end on an image that rhymes with the opening with altered moral charge.

Keep beats **performable** without prescribing camera or lighting decisions.

---

## Sequence planning (units bigger than scenes)
Group beats into **sequences** with identifiable mini-goals and failure modes. For each sequence, ensure you can articulate:
- **Objective under a clock,** visible to the audience.  
- **Opposition method** tied to a system (law/tech/ecology) so consequences are specific.  
- **Risked resource** (time, status, leverage, memory, fuel).  
- **State change** that hands the next sequence its starting gun.

Avoid enumerating scene minutiae; the Scenes Agent will fracture sequences into discrete scenes.

---

## Character engines that generate plot
For each principal:
- **Want / Need** (external pursuit vs internal correction).  
- **Flaw / Skill** (the tool that wins Act I costs Act II).  
- **Cost to win** (what they must spend).  
- **Cross-pressures** (two values they care about colliding).  
- **Relational geometry** (rivalry, mentorship, duty, romance) that guarantees conflict without specifying blocking.

---

## Thematic argument without speeches
Frame theme as a **contest of claims** (e.g., safety vs freedom). Let both sides win credible scenes. Import **Contradictory Truths** from lore so choices—not monologues—award points. Use **recurring motifs** sparingly and only where they crystallize the argument (e.g., a registry stamp that begins as salvation and ends as erasure).

---

## Promise-of-the-premise economy
List the signature kinds of sequences the audience expects given the logline and pillars (e.g., audit-day gambit, curfew run, quota tribunal). Ensure variety in **verbs** (chase, con, debate, siege, escape) and **scale** (intimate → public). Each should **spend** a resource and **earn** a new one (proof, key, leverage). Do not pre-decide scene blocking or shot texture.

---

## Mystery & question threads (if applicable)
Translate vagueness into a **chain of questions** answerable only through risky actions. Pre-decide the **evidence type** (object, confession, procedural result) for each answer so payoffs feel inevitable rather than convenient.

---

## Pacing, clocks, and compression
Install **visible clocks** (audit cycles, ferries, sunrise windows). Use **late entry/early exit** and **scene amalgamation** for momentum. Insert breathers that still *do work* (relationship turns, plant-heavy banter). Keep all guidance at the level of timing and consequence, not shot craft.

---

## Checks & balances
- **Power Audit:** any use of abilities honors **Cost / Limit / Counter**; if a late beat bends a rule, the price is brutal.  
- **Plant/Payoff ledger:** no plant without payoff, no payoff without plant.  
- **Stakes ladder:** escalate personal → relational → societal (as appropriate) without losing intimacy.  
- **Continuity of motive:** a character’s swerve must be traceable to new pressure or information from the prior unit.

---

## Diagnostics
- If you can reorder three adjacent beats without damage, you may have “and-then” plotting—strengthen opposition methods.  
- If removing a pillar doesn’t collapse your second act, your world isn’t actually driving story.  
- If the midpoint doesn’t reprice victory, it’s just a big scene; find the value flip.  
- If you can’t retell the story in verbs, objectives are mushy.

---

## Common failure modes & fixes
- **Speeching theme:** ideas stated instead of argued through consequence. → Force value collisions with real loss on both sides.  
- **Midpoint sag:** information arrives but stakes do not pivot. → Reveal a hidden cost or flip a pillar’s meaning.  
- **Climax with no echo:** ending image unrelated to beginning. → Reuse the opening motif under a new moral polarity.  
- **World as wallpaper:** rules never bite. → Inject a procedural obstacle from a pillar at every sequence hinge.

---

## Notes from craft
- **Mamet:** scenes exist to win objectives under opposition; if you can’t state those, you don’t have drama.  
- **Snyder:** protect space for “fun & games”—the world’s unique rules must *do work* in the middle.  
- **Field/McKee:** turning points are earned by choices, not weather; structure is meaning over time.  
- **Vogler/Truby:** inner change should be *expensive*—tie the price to your lore’s costs so theme and plot fuse.  
- **Pixar wisdom:** simplify, focus, combine; keep the audience slightly ahead, then slightly behind, in satisfying rhythm.
