# NARRATIVE GENERATION GUIDE (Step 3 — after logline & lore are locked)

**Purpose**  
Transform the premise and world bible into a causal spine and sequence plan that plays cleanly and hits hard **within a sub-10-minute runtime**. Focus on *decision pressure*: every unit forces a choice that raises cost or narrows options. Leave scene-by-scene blocking and shot craft to specialized agents; only specify thematically essential motifs when inseparable from the story’s argument.

---

## Choose a spine & emotional shape (declare your tools)
Select one beat engine (e.g., Story Circle-style 8-step, a tightened commercial 15-beat, or an investigation lattice) that expresses the core conflict with minimal overhead. Pair it with a clear **emotional trajectory** (rise, fall, fall-rise, zigzag). The **midpoint must reprice victory**—not merely drop information. Keep character count and location count tight so the structure reads instantly in this timescale.

---

## Build a causal beat grid tuned for compression
- **Launch late:** start after the inciting pressure is already on; let behavior against a pillar teach the rules. This aligns with the “enter late, exit early” maxim used by pro screenwriters.
- **Therefore/But logic:** every beat is forced by the last; decorative beats are cut.  
- **Act I:** establish ordinary operation under a rule, lock the public goal, cross no-return—without prologues.  
- **Act II:** escalate through reversals and pinch points that *spend* resources (time, tokens, allies) and exploit **Cost/Limit/Counter** from lore; the midpoint flips knowledge, allegiance, or price.  
- **Act III:** stage the decisive value choice implied by the logline’s irony; pay setups; end on an image that rhymes with the opening with altered moral charge.  
Short form favors one clean idea, one clear want, and a compact setting—avoid feature-style subplots.

---

## Sequence planning (units bigger than scenes)
Group beats into compact **sequences** with mini-goals and failure modes. For each, ensure you can state:
- **Objective under a clock** (visible to the audience).  
- **Opposition method** tied to a system (law/tech/ecology) so consequences are specific.  
- **Risked resource** (time, status, leverage, fuel, memory).  
- **State change** that hands the next sequence its starting gun.  
Keep guidance at sequence level—downstream agents will fracture into scenes and shots.

---

## Character engines (built for fast read)
For each principal:
- **Want / Need** expressed through *verbs*, not speeches.  
- **Flaw / Skill:** the tool that wins early creates the trap later.  
- **Cost to win:** what they must spend—make it legible.  
- **Cross-pressures:** collide two values they care about; compact stories thrive on sharp dilemmas.  
- **Relational geometry:** rivalry, mentorship, duty, romance that guarantees friction without prescribing blocking.

---

## Thematic argument by consequence
Frame the theme as a **contest of claims** (safety vs freedom; memory vs mercy). Let both sides win credible sequences. Import **Contradictory Truths** from lore so choices—not monologues—carry the argument. Use **recurring motifs** sparingly to crystallize thesis/antithesis.

---

## Promise-of-the-premise economy
List the signature kinds of sequences the premise promises (audit gambit, curfew run, tribunal bargain, storm crossing). Ensure variety in **verbs** (chase, con, debate, siege, escape) and **scale** (intimate → public). Each sequence should **spend** something and **earn** something (proof, key, leverage). Favor one or two locations and a small cast to keep momentum.

---

## Dialogue, pacing, and compression (short-form specifics)
- **Purposeful dialogue only:** every line either reveals character or advances plot—trim greetings, recaps, and filler.  
- **Get into scenes late:** assume the audience can catch up; trust cut-in action and visual exposition.  
- **Visual beats over explanation:** let procedures, counters, and props *prove* rules; reserve words for turns.  
- **Runtime targeting:** ideas that land in 5–10 minutes travel farther with curators and audiences than longer shorts; build for that window from outline.

---

## Mystery & question threads (if applicable)
Convert vagueness into a **chain of questions** that can only be answered through risky actions. For each, pre-decide **evidence type** (object, confession, procedural result) so payoffs feel inevitable, not convenient.

---

## Checks & balances
- **Power Audit:** any power use honors **Cost / Limit / Counter**; if a late beat bends a rule, the price is brutal.  
- **Plant/Payoff ledger:** no plant without payoff, no payoff without plant.  
- **Stakes ladder:** escalate personal → relational → societal (as appropriate) without losing intimacy.  
- **Continuity of motive:** a swerve must trace to new pressure or information from the prior unit.

---

## Diagnostics for short-form strength
- If you can reorder three adjacent beats without damage, you’re in “and-then” plotting—tighten opposition methods.  
- If removing a pillar doesn’t collapse Act II, the world isn’t driving story.  
- If the midpoint doesn’t redefine victory, it’s just a big scene—find the value flip.  
- If you can’t retell the story in **verbs**, objectives are mushy.  
- If the ending image doesn’t rhyme with the opening, theme may not have landed.

---

## Common failure modes & fixes
- **Speeching theme:** ideas announced instead of argued through cost → Force value collisions with real loss.  
- **Midpoint sag:** info arrives, stakes don’t pivot → Reveal a hidden cost or flip a pillar’s meaning.  
- **World as wallpaper:** rules never bite → Inject a procedural obstacle from a pillar at every sequence hinge.  
- **Over-population:** too many faces dilute causality → Merge roles; concentrate pressure.

---

## Practitioner wisdom for **sub-10-minute** narratives
- **Favor one idea, one situation, one emotional core;** shorts that keep to a single clean throughline connect faster and travel better with festivals.  
- **Under ten plays better**—curators can program more of them; aim 5–10 minutes unless the concept truly demands more.  
- **"Enter late, exit early."** Goldman/Myers' mantra is especially potent at this length—skip wind-ups and hang-tails.  
- **Keep it simple and short;** don't condense a feature—select the smallest slice that carries resonance.  
- **Get into scenes late; make dialogue do double duty;** Backstage emphasizes purposeful lines, minimal locations, and fast identification of the goal within a page—use that economy as a design constraint.

## Notes from craft
- **Mamet:** scenes exist to win objectives under opposition; if you can’t state those, you don’t have drama.  
- **Snyder:** reserve room for a distilled “fun & games” slice—one unmistakable sequence where the premise struts.  
- **Field/McKee:** turning points are earned by choices, not weather; structure is meaning over time.  
- **Vogler/Truby:** inner change must be *expensive*—tie the price to the lore’s costs so theme and plot fuse.  
- **Pixar/Emma Coats heuristics:** simplify, focus, pick the ending early—useful constraints when minutes are scarce.
