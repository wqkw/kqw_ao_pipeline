# Guide to different types of narratives

# 1) Archetypal plot arcs (what the story *does*)

* **Overcoming the Monster**

  * Variants: external beast/antagonist • systemic/organizational “monster” • inner demon/addiction.
  * Beats: threat signaled → first clash fails → learn/gather tools → breach lair → death-match → return with proof.
* **Rags to Riches**

  * Variants: pure ascent • ascent→fall→true ascent (after values-test) • false victory (hollow success).
  * Beats: ordinary lack → break/opportunity → early wins → arrogance/backlash → humbling → earned status.
* **The Quest**

  * Variants: fetch quest (clear MacGuffin) • pilgrimage (internal change) • rescue (time pressure).
  * Beats: call → team assemble → trials/waystations → dark route/guardians → boon secured → hard way home.
* **Voyage & Return**

  * Variants: wonderland (rules discovery) • culture clash (assimilation) • survival (hostile environment).
  * Beats: crossing into strange realm → misread rules → mastery at a cost → escape attempt → re-entry changed.
* **Comedy**

  * Variants: misrecognition/identity play • matchmaker engines • society out of joint → restored.
  * Beats: tangled webs → mounting complications → “mask off” revelations → reconciliations → new social order.
* **Tragedy**

  * Variants: fatal flaw recognized too late • noble sacrifice that fails • corruption arc (slow rot).
  * Beats: rise on flawed premise → warnings ignored → point of no return → irreversible harm → recognition → collapse.
* **Rebirth**

  * Variants: seasonal thaw (soft reset) • intervention/grace encounter • near-death literal or social.
  * Beats: stagnation/curse → encounter with catalyst → resistance → ego death → renewal with altered identity.

# 2) Emotional “shapes” (how fortune rises/falls)

* **Rise (Rags-to-Riches)**: lack → lift → test of values → consolidation.
* **Fall (Tragedy)**: early strength → misjudgment → accelerating costs → ruin.
* **Fall→Rise (“Hole→Out”)**: disruption → descent/alienation → insight → reconstructed life.
* **Rise→Fall (“Icarus”)**: meteoric ascent → hubris → snap reversal → consequence settling.
* **Rise→Fall→Rise (“Cinderella”)**: gift/chance → loss/exile → return/recognition.
* **Fall→Rise→Fall (“Oedipal Zigzag”)**: partial recovery → fatal discovery → second collapse.
* Dial knobs you can set: where the **true pivot** sits (pre-midpoint / midpoint / late), whether the **lowest low** precedes insight, and if the end-state is **stable** or **ambiguous**.

# 3) Journey cycles (quest/return beat engines)

* **Monomyth (Hero’s Journey, 17-ish moves)**

  * Departure: call → refusal → mentor → threshold → belly of the whale.
  * Initiation: trials/allies/enemies → approach → ordeal → reward.
  * Return: road back → resurrection → return with elixir.
  * Useful toggles: “mentor-light” (knowledge found, not given) • “two thresholds” (public vs private).
* **12-Stage Writer’s Journey (streamlined)**

  * Ordinary world → call → refusal → mentor → break into special world → tests/allies/enemies → approach → ordeal → reward → road back → resurrection → return.
  * Dial: compress tests into montage • move “mentor” post-threshold as a guardian.
* **Story Circle (8 steps)**

  * You (comfort) → Need (desire named) → Go (cross line) → Search (trial/learn) → Find (get it) → Take (pay price) → Return (come back) → Change (integrate).
  * Micro-beats per step: decision • action • feedback • adjustment.
* **15-Beat Commercial Beat Sheet**

  * Opening image → theme stated → setup → catalyst → debate → break-into-2 → B-story → fun & games (promise of premise) → midpoint (win/lose + stakes shift) → bad guys close in → all is lost → dark night → break-into-3 → finale (plan → execution → new order) → final image.
  * Knobs: “false victory” midpoint vs “false defeat” midpoint; finale framed as team plan or single gambit.

# 4) Act-based dramatic spines (page-level scaffolding)

* **Three-Act**

  * Act I: setup + inciting incident + lock-in (no return).
  * Act II: complications → midpoint reversal → pinch points that squeeze → crisis decision.
  * Act III: climactic confrontation → outcome → resolution.
* **Five-Act / Freytag**

  * Exposition → rising action (two escalations) → climax (decision + turn) → falling action (aftershocks) → denouement (new equilibrium).
  * Additions: “mirror midpoint” scene • “obligatory scene” promised by premise.

# 5) Non-Western progressions (contrast & cadence)

* **Kishōtenketsu (Qi-Cheng-Zhuan-He)**

  * Intro → development (elaboration) → **turn** (new element reframing prior beats) → conclusion (harmonization).
  * Turn types: perspective flip • rule reveal • metaphor echo • detail recontextualization (no antagonist required).
* **Jo-Ha-Kyū (Begin-Break-Rush)**

  * Jo: calm establishment and motif.
  * Ha: fracture/variation; tempo and stakes lift in waves.
  * Kyū: compressed, decisive finish; no long denouement.
  * Dials: how sharply Ha fractures; whether Kyū resolves cleanly or with a sting.

# 6) Investigation-forward progressions (mystery engines)

* **Whodunit**

  * Subtypes: closed-circle (finite suspects) • procedural (institutional method) • fair-play puzzle (clued for audience).
  * Beats: crime & question posed → evidence passes (red herrings planted) → mid-theory that fails → narrowing field → reveal (method + culprit) → reconstruction.
* **Howcatchem (Inverted)**

  * Beats: show crime & culprit → investigator fixates on anomaly → battle of wits (cat-and-mouse setpieces) → trap construction → public catch/exposure → ethical afterbeat.
* **Whydunit**

  * Beats: outcome known → back-tracking motives → confession precipitated by emotional key → meaning reframed more than facts.
* Add-ons: ticking clock • second body raising stakes • unreliable witness • locked-room constraint.

# 7) Ensemble & perspective weaves (how threads braid)

* **Network/Hyperlink**

  * Patterns: hub-and-spokes (one nexus) • ring (A→B→C→…→A) • lattice (many small crossings).
  * Beats: introduce nodes with motif → crossovers tighten causality → convergence event → distributed resolution (new network state).
* **Braided Dual (or Triple) Protagonists**

  * Alternating arcs with mirrored beats (two midpoints speak to each other) → collision → fused climax → negotiated denouement.
* **Rashomon-Style Multi-Account**

  * Beats: baseline incident → testimony A (frame/agenda) → testimony B (conflict) → synthesis pass (which truths persist?) → adjudication or ambiguity preserved.
* **Relay/Baton-Pass**

  * One POV carries act; baton passes at crisis → each pass changes stakes or knowledge; ensemble finale requires contributions from multiple prior POV arcs.
* **Chorus/Mosaic**

  * Many shorts orbit a theme; progress by accumulation rather than causality; final movement aggregates meaning.

# 8) Time & frame patterns (ordering as engine)

* **Frame/Nesting**

  * Outer narrator sets premise → inner tale(s) unfold → returns that comment or invert frame; recursion depth can mirror theme (story about storytelling).
* **Reverse Chronology**

  * End state first → stepwise earlier reveals; beats designed as successive “because” answers; final beat shows the true beginning cause.
* **Time-Loop**

  * Subtypes: perfect reset • memory accrual for lead only • world remembers prior cycles • branching loop (changes persist).
  * Beats: first bewilderment loop → rules discovery → exploitation montage → moral/meaning test → exit condition triggered or acceptance.
* **Forking Paths/Alternates**

  * Beats: choice point → branch montage → cross-branch echoes → convergence (or deliberate non-convergence).
* **Fractured Timeline Mystery**

  * Two (or more) intercut timelines → hidden hinge scene reveals how they interlock → re-read prior beats with new understanding.

# 9) Goal-engineered missions (heists, capers, ops)

* **Heist/Caper Spine**

  * Beats: motive/need → assemble specialized crew → intel and plan (with explicit contingencies) → rehearsal or dry run → execution (live complications force improvisations) → reveal layer (what we didn’t know about the plan) → fallout/aftermath (who gets what).
  * Variants: double-cross ladder • long con (confidence cycle) • smash-and-grab (pure kinetics).
* **Team Operation**

  * Beats: objective brief → role assignment → parallel sub-ops (A/B/C threads with interdependence) → choke-point convergence → extract/cleanup.
* **Bottle Mission**

  * Constrained space/time; progress via resource depletion and inventive re-use; the “plan” forms mid-mission.

# 10) Formal morphology (atomic move sets to generate beats)

* **Proppian Function Clusters (31 functions compressed)**

  * Preparation: interdiction → violation → reconnaissance by villain.
  * Villainy & Lack: harm or lack identified → dispatch/decision to quest.
  * Donor Sequence: donor test → hero’s reaction → receipt of magical aid.
  * Guidance: journey → struggle → branding/wounding (mark of trial).
  * Victory & Liquidation: villain defeated → initial lack resolved.
  * Return: pursuit → rescue → unrecognized return → unfounded claims by false hero → difficult task → solution → recognition → exposure of false hero → transfiguration → punishment → wedding/new order.
  * Use: treat these as **plug-in steps** to invent missing beats within any spine above.

## Quick ways to pick & combine

* Choose **one arc** from §1 + **one shape** from §2 to define *what* changes and *how it feels*.
* Snap on a **beat engine** from §3/§4 to pace it.
* If your premise is investigation-first, swap the beat engine for §6.
* For multi-thread projects, start with §7, then assign each thread its own mini-shape from §2.
* If you want elegance without constant conflict, try §5.
* When stuck, open §10 and pick the next plausible **function** to advance the progression.

If you give me your premise, tone (e.g., tragic vs redemptive), and format (e.g., 90s feature, 10×2-min episodes), I’ll snap together a custom beat outline using this hierarchy.
