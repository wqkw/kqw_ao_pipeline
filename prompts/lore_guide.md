# GUIDE TO MAKING LORE

# What makes good lore (simple rules)

**1) Make it help the story.**
Every fact should affect what people *do* or *decide*.
*Example:* “Crossing the border costs a memory” forces hard choices.

**2) Pick a few hard rules.**
Choose 2–3 world rules and let everything follow from them.
*Example:* “No long-range messages at night.” Now people miss meetings, smuggle notes, light beacons, etc.

**3) Power always has a price.**
If something can do wonders (tech, magic, law), nail down:

* What it does
* What it costs
* Where it fails
* How people fight or dodge it
  *Example:* Healing works but ages you a year; salt blocks it.

**4) Be concrete, not vague.**
One receipt, coin, notice, or proverb says more than a paragraph of lore.
*Example:* A ration card with a red “EXILE” stamp tells a whole story.

**5) Let truths disagree.**
Different groups believe different versions of events. That’s good.
*Example:* The guild calls it “safety law”; smugglers call it “a tax.”

# What to define (keep it small)

**Pillars (3–5):** the big ideas that set the feel and limits.
*Example:* “Salt is currency,” “machines rust fast,” “tone is grounded-weird.”

**Systems (a one-liner each):**

* Can do → Cost → Limit → Counter
  *Example:* “Radio at dawn → needs fresh batteries → dead after sunrise → couriers beat it at night.”

**Culture (inside view):**
Everyday stuff: work rhythms, insults, rituals, funerals, childcare. Add 2–3 props per place (coins, stamps, permits, food).

**History (only the hits):**
5–10 turning points. For each: what caused it, who won/lost, what still matters.

**Places that matter:**
Why a city exists here, how long travel takes, where the chokepoints are (passes, bridges, checkpoints).

# How to reveal it (without dumping)

**One new thing at a time.**
When you share lore, add just one new “thing,” one way it’s used, and one rule about it.

**Show more than you tell.**
Rough guide: mostly shown by behavior/props, a bit through found items (maps, notes), a tiny bit spoken out loud.

**Use practical points of view.**
Customs officer, porter, undertaker, radio op—people who know procedures and prices, not encyclopedias.

**Answer and open.**
Each reveal should pay off a previous question and create a fresh, answerable one.

# Keep it consistent

**Single source of truth.**
One page or doc with the rules. Mark what’s “hard” (can’t change) vs “soft” (can bend).

**Audit new powers.**
Any new ability or item must list its cost, limit, and counter so stakes don’t break.

**Name & tone rules.**
Pick how names sound and the mood you want. Stick to it.

# Common mistakes (avoid)

* Lists of names with nothing happening
* Free, unlimited powers
* Everything is “amazing” and nothing is inconvenient
* Inconsistent naming
* Tone that drifts every time
