# LORE GENERATION GUIDE (Step 2 — after a logline is selected)

**Purpose**  
Forge a compact, decision-driving world bible that **changes what characters do**, tuned for a story that must ignite and resolve quickly. Keep it gameable: a few hard rules, explicit costs, visible counters, and contradictions that factions can weaponize. Leave granular prop inventories and shot-level texture to downstream agents; only surface material culture when it is essential to choice, theme, or conflict.

---

## Derive from the logline (quick method)
1) **Extract 1–2 levers** embedded in the premise (communication limit, rationing law, ecological hazard).  
2) **Translate levers to behaviors:** how people *cope, cheat, hustle, worship*. If behaviors don’t spring to mind, the lever is decorative.  
3) **Name counter-forces & methods:** who profits, who pays, and **how** (audits, checkpoints, rituals, sensors).  
4) **Surface a live contradiction:** two opposed truths about the same institution/tech that both have evidence.  
5) **Gate reveals to action:** teach rules only when a character needs them to choose.

---

## Pillars (3–5 immovables, each with bite)
For each pillar, state:
- **Implication:** what behavior it forces/forbids.  
- **Setpiece vector:** how it escalates or collapses a plan.  
- **Ownership:** which class/faction enforces or evades it.

Mark which pillar powers the **midpoint reversal** and which underwrites the **final value choice**.

---

## Systems with friction (the conflict engine)
For each major system (tech, magic, law, trade):
- **Can do** → enabling verb.  
- **Cost** → what it eats (time, memory, reputation, fuel).  
- **Limit** → when/where it fails (range, purity, sacred days, weather).  
- **Counter** → how savvy actors resist/spoof it (decoys, folk rituals, forged hashes, bribes).  
- **Observable tell** → behavior or public ritual that proves it’s operating.

Install one **pervasive inconvenience** (queues, inspections, curfews) that can interrupt any plan on cue.

---

## Social & material culture (only what alters choices)
- **Work rhythms/rituals** born from levers (audit days, offerings before travel).  
- **Taboos & slang** that encode risk.  
- **Permits/processes** everyone navigates.  
- **Sensory palette** (sounds, textures, light sources) only insofar as it reinforces pressure/theme; avoid shot prescriptions.

---

## History that still pushes the present
Five to ten **turning points** with:  
- **Persistents** (laws, scars, institutions) • **Winners/losers** • **False history** widely believed (for reveals later).

---

## Places that matter (functional, not scenic)
Three to six spaces with procedures and chokepoints. Define:  
- **Why here?** the resource or access it controls.  
- **Travel frictions** (permits, ferries, storms).  
- **Likely verbs** (confess, arbitrate, smuggle, test) without pre-blocking scenes.

---

## Contradictory truths (plot fuel)
Paired claims about the same object/law that different factions can argue and exploit. Both must carry evidence.

---

## Reveal plan (show, don’t dump)
Teach one new rule via **behavioral proof** (a bribe fails when audits rotate), **found process** (stamped chits, torn maps), or **public ritual**. Cap exposition to what lets a character act **now**.

---

## Continuity guards (stake integrity)
- **Hard vs Soft rule ledger;** if a soft rule flexes, cost rises.  
- **Power Audit:** any new ability declares Cost/Limit/Counter immediately.  
- **No free upgrades:** capability increases demand dramatizable sacrifice.

---

## Diagnostics
- Could a street hustler exploit every pillar? If not, edges are dull.  
- Do systems explain the villains’ business model? If not, re-wire incentives.  
- Can tweaking a rule sabotage a planned sequence? Good—rules drive plot.  
- If the protagonist changed professions, would plans still work? If yes, pressure is weak.

---

## Failure modes & fixes
- **Encyclopedia brain:** cool facts, no choices → Delete or tie to a decision.  
- **Rule sprawl:** many tiny rules, none recur → Collapse into 3–5 pillars; reuse relentlessly.  
- **Free tech/magic:** ability w/ no price → Attach devouring cost or cut.  
- **Backdrop culture:** festivals that never affect plans → Make them access gates or risks.

---

## Notes from craft
- **“Pick a few hard rules,” “power has a price,” “be concrete.”** They’re non-negotiable for tension.  
- **Hold contradictory truths** to keep theme alive without speeches.  
- **Le Guin/Tolkien/Herbert lineages:** ecology, economy, and ritual shape decisions better than backstory paragraphs.
