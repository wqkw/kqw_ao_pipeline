# LORE GENERATION GUIDE (Step 2 — after a logline is selected)

**Purpose**  
Forge a compact, decision-driving world bible that **changes what characters do**. Keep it gameable: a few hard rules, explicit costs, visible counters, and contradictions that factions can weaponize. Leave granular prop lists, environmental lighting, and shot design to downstream agents; only surface material culture when it is essential to choice, theme, or conflict.

---

## Derive from the logline (a short method)
1) **Extract the lever(s):** Identify 1–2 non-decorative constraints implied by the logline.  
2) **Translate to behavior:** List how ordinary people *cope, hustle, cheat,* or *worship* around each constraint. If you can’t list behaviors, the lever is decorative.  
3) **Name counter-forces:** Who profits? Who pays? Describe *operating methods* (inspections, audits, rituals, quotas).  
4) **Surface contradiction:** Two truths about the same institution/technology that both have evidence—fuel for theme and plot.  
5) **Gate reveals:** Decide what the audience must learn only when it unlocks a choice.

---

## Pillars (3–5 immovables)
Pick a few hard rules (physics, law, communication, ecology, cosmology). For each:
- **Implication:** what behavior it forces and what it forbids.
- **Setpiece vector:** how the rule can escalate or collapse a plan.
- **Ownership:** which class/faction enforces or evades it.

Flag which pillar underwrites the **midpoint reversal** and which one powers the **final value choice**.

---

## Systems with friction (conflict engine)
For each key system (tech, magic, law, trade):
- **Can do** → the enabling verb.  
- **Cost** → what it eats (time, memory, reputation, fuel).  
- **Limit** → when/where it fails.  
- **Counter** → how savvy actors resist or spoof it.  
- **Observable tells** → behavior the audience can *see* that proves it’s operating (avoid enumerating props; focus on *procedures* and *ritualized actions*).

Install at least one **pervasive inconvenience** (queues, tests, curfews) that can interrupt any plan on cue.

---

## Social & material culture (only what changes choices)
- **Work rhythms & rituals** that exist *because of* the levers (shift bells, audit days, offerings before travel).  
- **Taboos & slang** that encode risk exposure.  
- **Documents/permits** everyone navigates.  
- **Sensory palette** (sounds, textures, light sources) insofar as it reinforces the world’s pressure and theme; avoid shot-level instructions.

---

## History that still pushes the present
Five to ten **turning points** with:
- **Persistents:** what laws, scars, or institutions survived.  
- **Winners/losers:** who profited, who was marked.  
- **False history:** a widely believed but contested account you can play for reveals.

---

## Places that matter (functional, not scenic)
Three to six high-leverage spaces with procedures and chokepoints. Define:
- **Why here?** What this place controls (access, information, resources).  
- **Travel frictions** (permits, ferries, storms) that make movement costly.  
- **Likely verbs** (confess, smuggle, arbitrate, test) without pre-blocking scenes.

---

## Contradictory truths (plot fuel)
Paired claims about the same object/law (e.g., “Registers keep us safe” / “Registers erase us”) that different factions can argue and exploit.

---

## Reveal plan (show, don’t dump)
Teach one new rule at a time through **behavioral proof** (a bribe works until the audit flips), **found process** (stamped chits, torn maps), or **public ritual**. Cap exposition to what a character needs to act **now**.

---

## Continuity guards (stake integrity)
- **Hard vs Soft rule ledger;** if a soft rule flexes, the cost rises.  
- **Power Audit:** any new ability declares Cost/Limit/Counter immediately.  
- **No free upgrades:** increases in capability require sacrifice you can dramatize.

---

## Diagnostics
- Could a street hustler exploit every pillar you wrote? If not, the rules lack edges.  
- Do your systems explain your villains’ business models? If not, re-wire incentives.  
- Can tweaking a rule sabotage a setpiece idea? Good—rules drive plot.  
- If the protagonist changed professions, would the same plans still work? If yes, the world pressure is too weak.

---

## Common failure modes & fixes
- **Encyclopedia brain:** cool facts that never alter choices. → Delete or tie to a decision.  
- **Rule sprawl:** many tiny laws that don’t recur. → Collapse into 3–5 pillars and reuse across acts.  
- **Free tech/magic:** abilities with no price. → Attach a devouring cost or cut.  
- **Backdrop culture:** festivals with no plan impact. → Make them access gates or risks.

---

## Notes from craft
- **“Pick a few hard rules,” “power has a price,” “be concrete.”** Treat these as non-negotiables for tension.  
- **Hold contradictory truths** to keep theme alive; let characters marshal evidence on both sides.  
- **Le Guin/Tolkien/Herbert lineages:** ecology, economy, and ritual shape decisions more reliably than paragraphs of backstory.
