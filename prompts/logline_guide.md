# LOGLINE GENERATION GUIDE (Step 1)

**Purpose**  
Generate five materially different high-concept one-liners that sell the *world lever*, the *active conflict*, the *agent who collides with it*, and the *price of failure*. These are precision premise statements that imply a whole film or season in one breath. Downstream agents will handle props, scenes, and shot craft; keep the logline agnostic to those details unless a single emblematic image is essential to the hook.

---

## What a strong logline must *contain*
- **World lever:** One vivid, *operational* rule that changes behavior (e.g., nightly amnesia; permits for speech; tides that cut power). It should clearly generate setpieces without naming them.
- **Role-forward protagonist:** Identify a functional identity with built-in tools and blind spots (“exiled mathematician,” “rookie undertaker”) rather than a résumé or name.
- **Compelled goal:** A must-do action under time or risk (save / expose / escape / bargain / broker / survive / deliver).
- **Adversarial pressure:** A person, system, or environment that adapts back.
- **Stakes with an imageable consequence:** A concrete bill that comes due (deportation at dawn; habitat freeze; erased registry).
- **Ironic contrast:** Juxtapose elements that spark memory (sacred vs profane, high tech vs ritual, outlaw forced to audit).

Keep it **25–35 words**, anchored in causality (“When X, Y must, or Z.”), with **one specific** world detail and **no name soup**.

## Make the five options *truly different*
Vary across:
- **Engine:** quest • heist • investigation • survival • siege • infiltration • rivalry • political game.
- **Scale:** pressure-cooker single locale ↔ citywide scramble ↔ frontier/space.
- **Tone:** redemptive • noir • absurdist • romantic-tragic • hopeful-procedural.
- **Clock:** real-time • hard deadline • wave-driven events • slow squeeze.
- **POV geometry:** single-protag • two-hander • rotating ensemble.
- **Audience promise:** kinetic setpieces • puzzle-box reveals • character crucible.

---

## Diagnostic tests before you present
- **Remove the lever—does it still “work”?** If yes, it’s generic; sharpen the rule until it *forces* unique behavior.
- **Three implied sequences?** If you can’t instantly imagine them, increase specificity of conflict.
- **Adversary adapts?** Replace vague “the system” with a force that has operating methods.
- **Would a rival want to steal this?** If not, the hook’s faint.

---

## Common failure modes & quick repairs
- **Laundry list:** modifiers pile up, spine vanishes. → Delete descriptors; keep one lever, one consequence.
- **Situation not story:** “In a world where X…” without compulsion. → Add role + deadline + cost of inaction.
- **Soft stakes:** “or things get worse.” → Name the loss and the time it lands.

## Selection rubric (to pick one)
Conflict clarity • Setpiece inevitability • Character/world collision • Freshness • Expandability (Act II / seasonable) • Thematic pressure (values choice baked in).

---

## Respin “knobs”
Grittier↔funnier • Lower↔higher budget • Younger↔older lead • Single↔ensemble • More mystery↔more action • Swap engine • Tighten/loosen the clock.

## Notes from craft
- **Mamet:** drama is pursuit under pressure—each word should imply *fight, negotiate, or reveal*.  
- **McKee/Field:** the premise should imply turning points; if reversals aren’t embedded, later beats will feel stapled on.  
- **Vogler/Truby:** make want vs need legible inside role-world collision.  
- **Snyder:** ensure the “promise of the premise” reads immediately; audience should intuit what the middle will deliver without listing scenes.
