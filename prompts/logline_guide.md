# LOGLINE GENERATION GUIDE (Step 1) — tuned for **sub-10-minute** stories

**Purpose**  
Generate five materially different high-concept one-liners that sell the *world lever*, the *active conflict*, the *agent who collides with it*, and the *price of failure*. Because the **total runtime is under 10 minutes**, each option must promise a story that ignites fast, tracks cleanly, and resolves decisively—no subplots, no interpretive scaffolding, no multi-thread puzzle boxes. Downstream agents will handle props, scene lists, and shot craft; keep the logline agnostic to those, unless a single emblematic image is essential to the hook.

---

## What a strong short-form logline must *contain*
- **World lever (one line, one behavior):** A single operational rule that instantly explains *how people act differently here*. It must be so concrete that you can imagine three micro-setpieces without naming them (e.g., curfews that erase IDs at dawn, auctions that trade hours of life, rainfall that disables electronics). If the lever needs a paragraph to understand, it’s wrong for this length.
- **Role-forward protagonist:** A functional identity with tools and blind spots (“rookie undertaker,” “exiled mathematician,” “black-market registrar”). Roles generate verbs; resumes generate adjectives.
- **Compelled goal with a clock:** The goal must read as a transaction under pressure (deliver, expose, escape, broker) and imply immediate action. A visible or implied **deadline** is crucial at this length.
- **Adaptive adversary:** A person, system, or environment that pushes back with methods (inspections, quotas, sensors, storms)—not vibes. Name the *operating pressure*, not the lore behind it.
- **Concrete stakes:** State the unpaid invoice if they fail (deportation at sunrise, air cutoff, lost custody). The audience should *picture* the loss as soon as they hear it.
- **Ironic contrast / hook:** A clash that sticks in memory (outlaw forced to audit; pacifist trapped in a duel economy). Irony compresses character and theme into a single beat.

**Economy rules:** 25–35 words; one vivid world detail; no proper names unless iconic; causality phrased as *When X, Y must, or Z.*

## Make the five options *truly different* (within short-form constraints)
Vary:
- **Engine:** heist • investigation • survival sprint • siege in miniature • infiltration • rivalry • moral gamble.
- **Scale:** single-locale pressure cooker ↔ small-radius chase; avoid sprawl that demands geography lessons.
- **Tone:** redemptive • noir • absurdist • tragic-romantic • hopeful-procedural; keep tonal pivots legible.
- **POV geometry:** single-protag vs. two-hander; ensembles rarely read cleanly at this length unless tightly coupled.
- **Clock texture:** fixed deadline vs. cascading micro-deadlines (checkpoints, audits, ferries, tides).

---

## Short-form diagnostics (use before presenting)
- **Does the lever teach itself in one action?** If not, simplify it until one behavior demonstrates it.
- **Can a stranger repeat the conflict in 10 seconds?** If not, prune modifiers.
- **Do three implied sequences pop instantly?** If no, heighten the collision of role + lever.
- **If you strip the lever, is it still “a movie”?** If yes, it’s generic; sharpen.
- **Can you describe the adversary in one operational phrase?** (“Quota AI that flags mismatched chits at dawn.”)

---

## Failure modes & quick repairs (short-form edition)
- **Backdrop lever:** the rule never forces a choice → Reframe so it blocks the goal *now*.
- **Subplot creep:** two separate wants or a B-story → Merge wants or turn the B-story into a cost.
- **Vagueness:** “or things get worse” → Name the imageable consequence and the moment it lands.
- **Name soup:** four named factions or places → Replace with roles and functions.

---

## Selection rubric (pick the one that wins at this length)
Clarity under breath • Immediate engine • Setpiece inevitability • Cast economy • Freshness • Theme pressure (values collision you can stage in two beats).

---

## Respin “knobs” for fast iteration
Grittier↔funnier • Lower↔higher budget • Younger↔older lead • Single↔two-hander • More puzzle↔more chase • Swap engine • Tighten/loosen the clock.

## Notes from craft
- **Mamet:** pursuit under opposition—compress until every word implies *fight, negotiate, or reveal*.  
- **Snyder:** protect a miniature “fun & games” slice; if the premise can’t deliver one memorable sequence quickly, the logline won’t sing.  
- **McKee/Field:** in short form, one clean reversal often outperforms three soft turns.  
- **Vogler/Truby:** need vs. want must surface in action, not speeches; irony helps you show both at once.
