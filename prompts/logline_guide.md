# LOGLINE GENERATION GUIDE (Step 1) — tuned for **sub-10-minute** stories

**Purpose**  
Generate five materially different high-concept one-liners that sell the *world lever*, the *active conflict*, the *agent who collides with it*, and the *price of failure*. Because the **total runtime is under 10 minutes**, each option must promise a story that ignites fast, tracks cleanly, and resolves decisively—no subplots, no interpretive scaffolding, no multi-thread puzzle boxes. Downstream agents will detailed lore, narrative, scene lists, and shot craft; keep the logline agnostic to those, unless a single emblematic image is essential to the hook.

IMPORTANT: draw heavily from the contents of the moodboard. The world will look like that aesthetic, and the characters/props have to come from it (though dont feel pressured to use all of it).


## Make the five options *truly different* (within short-form constraints)
Vary:
- **Engine:** heist • investigation • survival sprint • siege in miniature • infiltration • rivalry • moral gamble.
- **Scale:** single-locale pressure cooker ↔ small-radius chase; avoid sprawl that demands geography lessons.
- **Tone:** redemptive • noir • absurdist • tragic-romantic • hopeful-procedural; keep tonal pivots legible.
- **POV geometry:** single-protag vs. two-hander; ensembles rarely read cleanly at this length unless tightly coupled.
- **Clock texture:** fixed deadline vs. cascading micro-deadlines (checkpoints, audits, ferries, tides).


## Notes from craft
- **Mamet:** pursuit under opposition—compress until every word implies *fight, negotiate, or reveal*.  
- **Snyder:** protect a miniature “fun & games” slice; if the premise can’t deliver one memorable sequence quickly, the logline won’t sing.  
- **McKee/Field:** in short form, one clean reversal often outperforms three soft turns.  
- **Vogler/Truby:** need vs. want must surface in action, not speeches; irony helps you show both at once.
